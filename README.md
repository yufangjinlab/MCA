#In this GitHub repository you can find both R and Python code for the "Improving cell type identification at single-cell level" paper. 

#In the R folder we put a sample code for Mouse Lung Tabula Muris we presented the results in the paper. For any other datasets you just need to create a 
seurat objest of the dataset and provide the gene marker set as we showed you in this sample.
